# Exercise 1
Write a function that mimics the behaviour of a typewriter.

Using setInterval display the word Keller one character at a time (one letter per second). Once the word is written on the screen clear the interval.

# Exercise 2
Write a function that displays every second that has passed on the page since it was opened. The display should be refreshed every second. If 60 seconds are elapsed, write "a minute has passed", then "2 minutes have passed" (for 120 seconds and more), etc.
